IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Be specific and detailed in all sections - avoid generic statements
2. Personalize the analysis based on the actual response patterns
3. For each trait or characteristic, provide context and specific examples
4. ENSURE ALL FIELDS HAVE SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT - never leave fields empty
5. Make intelligence scores reflect the depth and quality of responses (scale 65-95)
6. Every section must contain meaningful analysis
7. Ensure all JSON is properly formatted with quotes around all strings and proper nesting
8. Never use placeholder text or generic responses
9. USE EXACT CAMELCASE PROPERTY NAMES as shown in the schema (particularly for cognitive_patterning, emotional_architecture, and interpersonal_dynamics)

CRITICAL: NEVER use snake_case property names (like decision_making) in your JSON response. Always use camelCase (like decisionMaking) to match the schema exactly.
