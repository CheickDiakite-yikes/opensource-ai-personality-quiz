- Core Traits: Identify primary personality dimensions including conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism
- Growth Potential: Evaluate learning orientation, adaptability, and development opportunities
- Motivational Profile: Determine core drivers, values, and inhibitors

3. **Actionable Insights**
- Provide specific examples from responses
